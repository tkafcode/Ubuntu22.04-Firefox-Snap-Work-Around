# Ubuntu22.04-Firefox-Snap-Work-Around
A script to fix the crashing Firefox Snap install on Ubuntu 22.04LTS.

As anyone using `Ubuntu 22.04LTS` `Firefox` must have noticed, the `Snap` install crashes frequently, effectively destroying the `Firefox` installation entirely. The current recommended work-around to the issue is to install `Firefox` from the `Mozilla` repository instead of `Snap`. 

You can download a script that does it for you script here and run it after chmod +x as is. 

If you would like another version of Firefox, just follow the instructions in the script. Likely you'll have to change the version eventually, as the versions in the repo update frequently. The addons are in notes because Firefox doesn't allow scripting addons. They need to be added manually.
